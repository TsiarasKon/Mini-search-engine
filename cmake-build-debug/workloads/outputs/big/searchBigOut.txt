                 n euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004.
                  The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all 
                 of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value o
                 f its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popul
                 ar means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. "It's the Brazil business that's doing it," said ING analyst Gerard 
                 Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more
                  than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although
                  Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.
