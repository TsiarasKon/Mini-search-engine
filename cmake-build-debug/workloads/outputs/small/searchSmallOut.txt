                 the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a

                 for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. "2004's films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a reali

                 ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the Oscars." Mr Karger said the comic might boost yo

                tions. The panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win.  All expect The Aviator to win best f
                ilm, but many think it will be a close race between Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic and Eastwood's boxing drama Million 
                Dollar Baby. The other films nominated are wine comedy Sideways, factual drama Finding Neverland, and Ray Charles biopic
                 Ray.  "I'm pretty sure this is the year of The Aviator, though my own choice would be Sideways," said the Observer's Ph

                ilip French. "Sideways should win but it doesn't have a hope," said Jamie Graham of Total Film, a position shared by Fil
                m 2005 presenter Jonathan Ross. "The form going in to the Oscars points to The Aviator, but I liked Million Dollar Baby 
                                                                ^^

                o told the BBC News website. "But I'm beginning to think Eastwood will get it."  "I'd be very happy for Mike Leigh to wi
                n, but I don't think he has any chance," said Charles Gant, film editor of Heat. Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles has alr
                eady seen him win prizes at the Golden Globes, Baftas and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Mr Dams said this made him "out-an
                d-out favourite" to be named best actor on Oscar night. "Everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didn't win," he sa
                id. "If you're a betting man, he's as close as you get to a certainty." "If Paul Giamatti was nominated for Sideways it 
                would be a different game," says Total Film's Jamie Graham. "But Foxx will and should win."  With Vera Drake star Imelda
                 Staunton nominated for best actress alongside Kate Winslet, Britain has a good chance of victory - on paper. Jonathan R
                oss, for one, will be very happy if Winslet wins for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But while Wendy Ide of The T
                imes still thinks Staunton has a chance, Heat's Charles Gant believes her Bafta win will cut little ice with Academy vot
                ers. "I'd like Staunton to win, but her chances are not that great," said Mr Gant, who predicted a second Oscar for Hila
                ry Swank.  "I think Swank will win," said Mr French. "Imelda has got as far as she's going to get playing that role." St
                aunton is also the personal choice of Steven Gaydos, executive editor of industry magazine Variety. But while he tipped
